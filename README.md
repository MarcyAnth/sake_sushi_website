A fully repsonsive restuarant website based on one of my favourite cuisines! Here is the url for the website https://sushiandsake.herokuapp.com/home. A big issue I had
was getting the menu to work properly as that was the main focus of this project using JavaScript. Just an FYI this version is missing the JSON files for npm etc, as I had trouble
uploading the same files that are live on Heroku, so I just created a new folder.
